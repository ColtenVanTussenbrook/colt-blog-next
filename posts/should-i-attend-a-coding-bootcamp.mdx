title: 'Should I Attend a Coding Bootcamp'

Being a graduate from a coding bootcamp, I get asked this question all the time. My answer is always the same: it depends.

<br />

If you're reading this post, chances are you're considering taking the plunge and attending a coding bootcamp. I wanted to layout this post in four things you should consider before committing to a coding bootcamp. It's concise but I wanted to compile the things I wish I knew before signing up.

<br />

#### **1. Do I really want to write code every day?**

<br />

The first question you need to ask yourself is if you even enjoy coding. Too many people sign up for a coding bootcamp because they've heard phrases like "you'll make $75,000+ after only a 3-month course" and "the future is tech, you need to learn how to code". If you're signing up solely from one of these reasons, I'd strongly suggest taking a step back and deciding if you like to code first (especially cause most grads don't make anything _close_ to that figure right out of the gate).

<br />

The best way to know if you like to code is to, well, code! Head over to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and start into their free courses. I'd start with HTML and CSS and then move into JavaScript fairly quickly so you can get a grasp on an actual programming language right away. Even if nothing makes sense, pay attention to if you're enjoying the problem-solving process. If you enjoy it and move through some basic courses, try building a super basic webpage that uses JavaScript for at least something.

<br />

I would commit at least 2-3 months to this process. If after that time you're hungry for more, you can be fairly confident you're going to like coding as a career. Let's go to step 2.

<br />

#### **2. Should I sign up for an actual coding school or should I continue learning on my own?**

<br />

This is the question I asked myself for over a year. I went through step 1 and really liked to code, but I couldn't seem to get past the vicious cycle of doing some tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, building a basic webpage, getting stuck on complicated concepts, taking a break, going back to learn more only to realize I need to start back over.

<br />

I wanted to learn on my own, but I could not seem to break that cycle. If you're in the same boat and feel like you need an environment to basically _force_ you to learn, I'd move onto step 3. If you are learning and you feel good about continuing on your own, go for it! You can save thousands of dollars and honestly learn the same material you would in a coding bootcamp. I work with a few self-taught developers and they're some of the best I've worked with.

<br />

#### **3. How do I choose a coding bootcamp?**

If you're positive you want to continue learning how to code and you've determined you need a mentor or school setting to push you along, the next step is to choose from the hundreds of options available. The first thing you'll want to determine is if you'd prefer in-person or online classes (I'm currently writing this during the Covid-19 pandemic so online is the only option right now anyway).

<br />

I actually signed up for [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/) a year or so before I went to the actual bootcamp I chose (we'll get to that in a minute) but then backed out because I felt like if I was going to do an online course, I might as well just get more dedicated. I figured if I was going to spend the money I'd prefer to have an in-person format with instructors I could talk to face-to-face.

<br />

With that said, the remote-first work style has become much more refined in the last couple of years. I know a lot of the online coding schools are very well run and provide a great experience.

<br />

For me, I found one close to where I was living and checked out reviews on [coursereport.com](https://www.coursereport.com/). I'd recommend checking Course Report for both online and in-person classes. Once I verified it had a good reputation, I emailed them and then eventually met with one of the owners/founders. It was an easy decision from there.

<br />

I attended [Dev Point Labs](https://www.devpointlabs.com/) in Salt Lake City. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the SLC area. Their online course has greatly improved as well through the pandemic and would be a great option even if you're not in Utah.

<br />

One other piece of advice is to reach out to an alumni for the course you're looking into. You can find grads on LinkedIn and I'm willing to bet most people who have attended a bootcamp would be happy to talk candidly about their experience.

<br />

#### **4. Don't Give Up!**

<br />

Coding is hard. There is no easy path. No matter what bootcamp you decide on or if you decide to try and learn through FreeCodeCamp and other non-assisted online resources, you're going to hit roadblocks and consider giving up. When that inevitably happens, keep on going! Even if you feel like you're not understanding anything, keep pushing through and learning all you can. You'll be surprised after a little bit of struggling how much you have actually learned.

<br />

If you're enjoying it for the most part (other than those moments of rethinking your entire life's plans), I'd say you're on the right path and that coding will be a great career path. It will be worth it in the end. Once you see a project come to life that you built, you'll forget the struggles and feel accomplished.

<br />

I would advise against learning to code solely for the perks -- good pay and benefits, work from home options, etc -- and rather do it because you enjoy it. It's still a job, I'm not saying it needs to be a hobby. But you'll burn out too quickly if you're only doing it for the perks. You're constantly going to be learning even after the bootcamp and if you're miserable the entire time learning how to code, you're not going to enjoy it as a career.

<br />

Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions. I've helped several people decide whether or not to learn to code. I'm happy to help anyone reading this post and I will give sincere and honest advice.

<br />

Good luck in your journey!
